abstract: We design a formation controller for Multi Agent Systems such that the agents
  can form into the desired shape and track a given reference trajectory. The main
  feature of the proposed design is that not only the orientation of individual agents,
  but also the orientation of the whole formation is considered and is designed to
  be aligned with the moving direction of the reference trajectory, which helps the
  tracking movement to be smoother compared with the common tracking results. Moreover,
  the control inputs are designed in predefined input ranges to reflect the practical
  system. System stability is proved based on nonlinear system theory and some simulations
  are given to validate the proposed results.
