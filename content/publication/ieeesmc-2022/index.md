abstract: In this article, we design the controller for multiagent systems such that
  the agents with nonlinear dynamics can form into arbitrarily given shapes, rotate
  around the formation centroid at the given angular velocity, track the reference
  trajectory, and dynamically adjust the formation for obstacle avoidance. In addition,
  the proposed design ensures that the agents can be positioned with a specified order
  in the formation. We propose an extended model for the system to facilitate the
  design. To deal with the order issue, we introduce the phase weighting parameter
  and the phase penalty flow exchange mechanism such that the agent’s position can
  be adjusted to the desired order. With the aid of the proposed tools, we first design
  the formation controller for MAS with a planar unicycle model and then extend it
  to the three-dimensional space. The controller is designed based on information
  from the neighbors and is measured in the agents’ local reference frame. Moreover,
  unlike most of the existing works, the initial conditions are not restricted in
  our approach. Finally, system stability is proved via the Lyapunov theorem and several
  simulation examples are provided to validate our results.
