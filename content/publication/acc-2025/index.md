abstract: In multi-agent systems with coupled objectives and/or constraints, agents may misreport information to achieve individual gains. This issue is exacerbated when agents possess local decision-making power, such as in multi-agent trajectory planning, where the increased autonomy amplifies individual benefits at the expense of a higher social cost. To overcome this problem, we leverage the Vickrey-Clarke-Grove (VCG) framework and propose a strategyproof, two-stage mechanism. We further extend this mechanism to prioritized planning and prevent agents from manipulating their priority.
