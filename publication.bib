  abstract={The purpose of this paper is to design a control law such that the multi-agent system can form into arbitrary shape, rotate around the centroid which tracks a given trajectory, and further adjust the formation into various shapes based on the affine transformation command. Moreover, the specified order between agents is crucial in some tasks, and hence ordered formation is addressed in our approach. The information for controller is measured locally from the neighbors and is in the local reference frames. To facilitate the goals, we propose an extended model and introduce the penalty flow exchanging mechanism which deals with the ordered formation. The control law is derived based on stability analysis, and a simulation example is provided to validate our results.},

abstract = {We design a formation controller for Multi Agent Systems such that the agents can form into the desired shape and track a given reference trajectory. The main feature of the proposed design is that not only the orientation of individual agents, but also the orientation of the whole formation is considered and is designed to be aligned with the moving direction of the reference trajectory, which helps the tracking movement to be smoother compared with the common tracking results. Moreover, the control inputs are designed in predefined input ranges to reflect the practical system. System stability is proved based on nonlinear system theory and some simulations are given to validate the proposed results.}

  abstract={In this article, we design the controller for multiagent systems such that the agents with nonlinear dynamics can form into arbitrarily given shapes, rotate around the formation centroid at the given angular velocity, track the reference trajectory, and dynamically adjust the formation for obstacle avoidance. In addition, the proposed design ensures that the agents can be positioned with a specified order in the formation. We propose an extended model for the system to facilitate the design. To deal with the order issue, we introduce the phase weighting parameter and the phase penalty flow exchange mechanism such that the agent’s position can be adjusted to the desired order. With the aid of the proposed tools, we first design the formation controller for MAS with a planar unicycle model and then extend it to the three-dimensional space. The controller is designed based on information from the neighbors and is measured in the agents’ local reference frame. Moreover, unlike most of the existing works, the initial conditions are not restricted in our approach. Finally, system stability is proved via the Lyapunov theorem and several simulation examples are provided to validate our results.},

  abstract={In this article, we propose a new 3-D maneuver controller for a class of nonlinear multiagent systems (MASs) with nonholonomic constraint and saturated control. The system is designed under a distributed communication topology and the controller is more flexible and efficient for general formation maneuver tasks. The saturation design generates control inputs within pregiven bounds, which makes the system more applicable in practice. Moreover, based on the nonholonomic model, the proposed control also considers the heading angles of the agents. Thus, the maneuver controller can achieve a more natural tracking movement where the heading of the formation will align to the direction of the reference trajectory during the tracking motion. Several simulation examples are given to validate our results and demonstrate the competence for various maneuver tasks of MASs.},
